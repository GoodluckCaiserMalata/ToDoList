# My React To do list Application

Welcome to My React Application! This is a README file that provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the application locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-application.git
   ```

   This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd my-react-application
   ```

   Change into the project directory that was created by the cloning process.

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary dependencies required for the application to run. It might take a few moments to complete.

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and launch the application in your default web browser. Any changes made to the source code will automatically reload the application.

   You should see a message indicating that the application is running and the URL where it can be accessed (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the previous step (e.g., http://localhost:3000). The React application should now be displayed in your browser.

## Additional Scripts

In addition to the `npm start` command, the following scripts are available:

- **Build**: To build the application for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This command generates an optimized and minified production build of the application.

- **Test**: To run the test suites:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

  This command runs the test suites and displays the test results.
